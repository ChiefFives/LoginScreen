# LoginScreen
Login screen module for React Native

Quick project for beginners to show how to create a login page and navigate through screens using react navigation.

Using React Native CLI for building the app.
Added libraries for React Navigation and Coco Pods for iOS. For testing on Android, you might want to check the additional components needed/ libraries needed for using React Navigation from https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html

The project is still currently WIP. Thank you!
